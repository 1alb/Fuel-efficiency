The dataset used in this project contains vehicle efficiency information collected from Korean automobile records. It includes attributes such as vehicle model, manufacturer, vehicle type, usage category, combined fuel efficiency, driving range per charge, city efficiency, highway efficiency, and vehicle classification. The target variable, combined fuel efficiency (복합_연비), represents the overall energy efficiency of each vehicle under mixed driving conditions. The dataset required preprocessing to handle missing values and mixed-format entries before analysis. By examining factors like city and highway efficiency along with vehicle specifications, the dataset provides valuable insights into energy consumption patterns and supports accurate prediction of fuel efficiency using machine learning models.
